# C# Output

In order to output something in C#, we can use<br/>
- ```Console.WriteLine()``` <br/>
- ```Console.Write()```<br/>

The main difference between WriteLine() and Write() is that the Write() method only prints the data provided to it, while the WriteLine() method prints the data and moves to the start of next line as well.
