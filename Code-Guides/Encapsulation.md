# Encapsulation 

- Encapsulation is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods.
- If a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class.
- For this reason, Encapsulation is also referred to as Data Hiding.
