# Encapsulation 

- Encapsulation is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods.
- If a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class.
- For this reason, Encapsulation is also referred to as Data Hiding.
- Encapsulation can be described as a protective barrier that prevents the code and data being randomly accessed by other code defined outside the class.
- The main benefits of encapsulation is the ability to modify our implemented code without breaking the code of others who use our code.
- With this features Encapsulation gives Maintainability, Flexibility and Extensibility to our code.
