## Question 01

**Task 1** <br/> 
Create a C# Console application to covert user given Kilo Meter(Km) Value to Meter (m) value. Take a separate Class call “ConvertValues” and inside the class create a method call kilometerTOmeter. (No return type No Parameter Method). And display the answer within the method. Then create an object in main Class (program class) and call the method.

**Task 2** <br/>
Modify the same user defined method to method which accept a parameter value. That parameter value is the user given Km value. (No return type with parameter method). Display the answer by using the class object.

**Task 3** <br/> 
Modify the same user defined method to method which accept a parameter and return the answer at the end of the method. You should return the calculated Meter value at the end of the method. (With return type with parameter method). Display the answer by using class object.

## Question 02

Create a C# Console application to find the area and the circumference of a circle.

User should insert the radius value to the program. Program should contain a separate class call “FindValues”. Inside the separate class add two methods call findArea and findCircumference. Both these methods are methods which takes parameters. As the parameter you should pass the radius value. By using above two methods find the area and circumference of the circle and return the answer from both methods. Create a class object in main class and call both methods and display the answers.

## Question 03

Figure - 01 

    Enter 1 for Addition
    Enter 2 for Subtraction
    Enter 3 For Multiplication
    Enter 4 for Division

    Enter Your Choice : 3
    Enter Number 1: 25
    Enter Number 2: 2
    Your Answer is : 50

Create the above mentioned console application and display it to the user. If user need to do an Addition user need to insert 1 as the choice. For subtraction it should be 2 etc.<br/>

Your program should contain a separate class call “CalculateValues” and inside the class you should add four methods which perform four arithmetic operations. All the methods should take two parameters which are user inserted numbers. And at the end of the method return the answer out of the method.<br/>

In main class if user want to do an addition call only the addition method in separate class. If user want to do a subtraction call only the subtraction method in separate class. Etc. <br/>
And display the final answer as shown in the figure 01.

## Question 04

Add a separate class file to Console application program and create a method call ```private void sayHello( )```.

Inside the method display ```hello world```.<br/>

In main class create a class object and try to access the ```sayHello( )``` method by using the class object.<br/>
Can you access the method? Explain why?
