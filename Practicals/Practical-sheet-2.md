## Question 01

**Task 1** <br/> 
Create a C# Console application to covert user given Kilo Meter(Km) Value to Meter (m) value. Take a separate Class call “ConvertValues” and inside the class create a method call kilometerTOmeter. (No return type No Parameter Method). And display the answer within the method. Then create an object in main Class (program class) and call the method.

**Task 2** <br/>
Modify the same user defined method to method which accept a parameter value. That parameter value is the user given Km value. (No return type with parameter method). Display the answer by using the class object.

**Task 3** <br/> 
Modify the same user defined method to method which accept a parameter and return the answer at the end of the method. You should return the calculated Meter value at the end of the method. (With return type with parameter method). Display the answer by using class object.

## Question 02

Create a C# Console application to find the area and the circumference of a circle.

User should insert the radius value to the program. Program should contain a separate class call “FindValues”. Inside the separate class add two methods call findArea and findCircumference. Both these methods are methods which takes parameters. As the parameter you should pass the radius value. By using above two methods find the area and circumference of the circle and return the answer from both methods. Create a class object in main class and call both methods and display the answers.
