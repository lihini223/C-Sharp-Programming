### Q-01
Create a class called “Employee” which has 3 private variables (empID, empName, empDesignation)
and create getters and setters for each field. Please note that this has no main method since this is
just an added class to the console application. Inside the main class take user inputs for employee id ,
employee name. employee designation and pass values to added class and set values.
From getters return relevant values and print the following message from main method.<br/>
“Hello – ```Employee name``` – Your Employee ID is – ```EMPID```—and You are a – ```EmpDesignation``` --.
