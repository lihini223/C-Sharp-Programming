Create a Console application with two classes (Main class + another class).

Inside the main class take a user input which is the size of the array.

Pass the user inserted size as a parameter to the added class method.

Inside the method create an integer array based on passed value from main method.

Every user input value should be followed by value 0 inside the array.

Eg: Assume array size is 9 and it should as follows;

```U.Input 0``` ```U.Input 0``` ```U.Input 0``` ```U.Input 0``` ```U.Input```

Now print all the values inside the array.
